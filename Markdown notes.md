## Section - Understanding Psuedocode
---


- Pseudocode is a language that doesn't actually run anywhere. It still represents programing concepts that are common across programming lanugages. 

- Funny thing is that they say that Pseudocode have different **"Flavors"**. I think that they mean that there are differnt types and ways to use it.

## Section - Storing data in variables
---

- Everything has a name a value and a type 
- You just need to use the right code to store and make sure you can grab it. You can add things without them actually storing

## Section - Mathematical expressions
---
- Arithmetic operators - This is used in programming languages to be used to create mathematical expressions.

## String Operations 
---
- Computers dont just storesrings they can also manipulate them
- Concatenation - Fancy way if describing how we combine strings together It comes from the two latin words con- ("together) and catenare- ("chain"). It "chains together" the strings

## Logical Equivalence
---
- Logical equivalence is the idea that mroe than one expression can have the same meaning, but have a different form (often a form that helps make the meaning more clear). 
- Using a lot of if/and/or statements all in one sentance can confuse the situation for the sintax. Keeping it simple will make the code run easy even if the sentance isn't how you would normally say it in person.

# Extra Notes _NOT_ from Khan

>Tried to insert a photo and it did not work. 

- **Need to look into on how to add photos from the computer and not just the internet**

<p>&nbsp;</p>

>This is a new note as well. I have been trying to figure out how to make multiple spaces between the sections and it has not been working. I got it figured out! See the code below.
